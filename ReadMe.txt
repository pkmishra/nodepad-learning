This is my endeavor to learn node.js.I have followed the tutorial presented on dailyjs (http://dailyjs.com/2010/11/01/node-tutorial/) however since the original article is quite old some of the libraries and source code(https://github.com/alexyoung/nodepad) is a little bit outdated.I tried to correct the code after each tutorial so that others may use it.
